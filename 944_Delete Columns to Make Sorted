You are given an array of n strings strs, all of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one on each line, making a grid. For example, strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"] can be arranged as:

abc
bce
cae
You want to delete the columns that are not sorted lexicographically. In the above example (0-indexed), 
columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not, so you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int res = 0;
        int n = strs[0].length();
        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++) {
            int temp = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            for(String c : strs) {
                int a = Integer.valueOf(c.charAt(i));
                if(a>=temp) {
                    temp = a;
                } else {
                    res++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
