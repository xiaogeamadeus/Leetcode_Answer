There are n flights that are labeled from 1 to n.

You are given an array of flight bookings bookings, 
where bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi] represents a booking for flights firsti through lasti (inclusive) with seatsi seats reserved for each flight in the range.

Return an array answer of length n, where answer[i] is the total number of seats reserved for flight i.
